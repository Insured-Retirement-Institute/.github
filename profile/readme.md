## Current specifications
The Producer CanSell and ActivityStatus APIs are not and will not be included on this platform until certain open questions are resolved. Users will be notified if and when these APIs are added to the platform.

We are currently in the process of standing up [SwaggerHub](https://wwww.swaggerhub.com) to host OpenAPI definitions. More to come.
